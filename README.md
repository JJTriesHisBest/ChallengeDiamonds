# Challenge 4 - Diamonds

I drew some of these out from A - C and counted the number of letters in each diamond. Out of curiosity I then googled that sequence 1, 5, 13 and the first wiki result was **Centered square number**. Pretty cool stuff!

I generated the letters based on their unicode values, and took advantage of the shape's symmetry by using reverse slices to create the rest of the diamond from the top left section.

## Usage
```
python create_diamond.py [A-Z]
```
